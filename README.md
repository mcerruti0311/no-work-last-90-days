## Talent Management report on employees that haven't worked in the last 90 days

This report is designed to give Talent Management leadership a list of active
employees that were hired over 30 days ago and haven't worked in the last 90
days.

The report is generated by running a left anti join query, with "NOT IN" as
part of the WHERE clause.  This returns a list of employees that haven't worked
in the last 90 days.

A second query is used to generate the last time a UTM record was created for
these employees using the MAX function.

Using Conga the two queries are added to an Excel spreadsheet and using a
vlookup formula on the first query display the last time the employee worked.
